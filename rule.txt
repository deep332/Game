This is a simple card game.
Player with the largest Card number is the winner in which 'A'(ACE) being the largerst and '2' smallest
Intitally you have to choose between two modes in which you want to play "BLIND" or "SHOW"
You can also choose with how many cards you want to play between 3-26 (recommended 6 or 10)

----------Modes----------
1) In BLIND mode you wont be able to see your cards and you will randomly pick any card that is in your possesion
2) In SHOW mode you will be able to choose your own card and put forward to Play(In this mode Turn on your CAPSLOCK or it wont take proper input)

----------Rule----------
1) Both Player are given one chance to put one card forward at a time for play, the player with the largest number on card
wins the round and gets the looser cards thereby reducing the card count with the looser and Increaseing its own 
2) Player to Acquire all cards first wins the game

----------Condition----------
1) If both the players Draw the card with same number then "It's a War" new Mode automatically being activated
    In this modde both player will loose their respective cards and another draw will be made but depending on pervious mode choosen by the player
    this draw will be diffrent (eg: if you have choosen "BLIND" mode before then in this Draw it'll be "SHOW" mode and you can select which card 
    you have to draw next and if you have choosen "SHOW" mode before then this draw will be random and you dont get to choose the card you want to draw )
2) During War mode the looser looses 2 Cards at a time benefiting the opponent whose count remains constant
3) If in the end a player has only one card left but it is "A"(Ace) then he/she wins irrespective of the how many cards are left with the opponent
4) In the end both player are left with single card and of same number then it's a draw
